# This Ruby script runs the SnowPlow StorageLoader.
#
# This is a three-step process:
# 1. Download the SnowPlow event files from In Bucket to the local filesystem
# 2. Load the SnowPlow event files into the target storage (currently, only Infobright is supported)
# 3. Archive the processed SnowPlow event files from In Bucket to Archive Bucket
#
# Note that each step is only actioned if the previous step succeeded without error.
